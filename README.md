# pyotgw

A python library to interface with the OpenTherm Gateway

See http://otgw.tclcode.com for the hardware.

This library is written primarily for use with Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io) but can be used for other purposes as well.
Parts of the code have not been thoroughly tested since my thermostat and boiler do not support all OpenTherm features. Feel free to test and contribute where you see fit.

### Library Reference

#### General
pyotgw exposes its OpenThermGateway class which uses [pyserial-asyncio](https://pyserial-asyncio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to connect to the OpenTherm Gateway.
After initialization of the object, `OpenThermGateway.connect()` should be used to establish a connection. The object will maintain the connection in the background, using it to send commands and continuously receive updates. The received information will be cached on the object for instant availability.
The OpenThermGateway object implements a watchdog to monitor the connection for inactivity. During `OpenThermGateway.connect()`, an inactivity timeout can be set for this purpose. Normally, the OpenTherm Gateway will send a message on its serial interface approximately every second. If no messages are received for the duration of the timeout, the watchdog will trigger a reconnection attempt.

#### Getting Data
There are multiple ways to get information from pyotgw. Calling `OpenThermGateway.connect()` will request some initial information from the Gateway and return it in a dict. After this, the OpenThermGateway object exposes quite a few methods which return values that are cached on the object. There is also the option to register a callback with `OpenThermGateway.subscribe()` which will be called when any value changes.

#### Methods

---
##### OpenThermGateway()
The OpenThermGateway constructor takes no arguments and returns an empty OpenThermGateway object.

---
##### OpenThermGateway.add_alternative(_self_, alt, timeout=OTGW_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)
Add the specified data-ID to the list of alternative commands to send to the boiler instead of a data-ID that is known to be unsupported by the boiler.
Alternative data-IDs will always be sent to the boiler in a Read-Data request message with the data-value set to zero. The table of alternative data-IDs is stored in non-volatile memory so it will persist even if the gateway has been powered off.
This method supports the following arguments:
- __alt__ The alternative data-ID to add. Values from 1 to 255 are allowed.
- __timeout__ The timeout for the request. Defaults to OTGW_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT (3 seconds).

Returns the ID that was added to the list, or None on failure.

This method is a coroutine.

---
##### OpenThermGateway.add_unknown_id(_self_, unknown_id, timeout=OTGW_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)
Inform the gateway that the boiler doesn't support the specified data-ID, even if the boiler doesn't indicate that by returning an `unknown-dataID` response.
Using this command allows the gateway to send an alternative data-ID to the boiler instead.
This method supports the following arguments:
- __unknown_id__ The data-ID to mark as unsupported. Values from 1 to 255 are allowed.
- __timeout__ The timeout for the request. Defaults to OTGW_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT (3 seconds).

Returns the added ID, or None on failure.

This method is a coroutine.

---
##### OpenThermGateway.connect(_self_, port, timeout=5)
Connect to an OpenTherm Gateway and initializes the parameters obtained from the `PS` and `PR` commands.
If called while connected, reconnect to the gateway.
All optional serial-related arguments default to the OpenTherm Gateway default settings.
This method supports the following arguments:
- __port__ The port/url on which the OpenTherm Gateway can be reached as supported by [pyserial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/url_handlers.html).
- __timeout__ The inactivity timeout in seconds after which the watchdog will trigger a reconnect. Defaults to 5.

Returns a status dict with all known values.

This method is a coroutine.

---
##### OpenThermGateway.disconnect(_self_)
Disconnect from the OpenTherm Gateway and clean up the object.

This method is a coroutine.

---
##### OpenThermGateway.del_alternative(_self_, alt, timeout=OTGW_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)
Remove the specified data-ID from the list of alternative commands.
Only one occurrence is deleted. If the data-ID appears multiple times in the list of alternative commands, this command must be repeated to delete all occurrences. The table of alternative data-IDs is stored in non-volatile memory so it will persist even if the gateway has been powered off.
This method supports the following arguments:
- __alt__ The alternative data-ID to remove. Values from 1 to 255 are allowed.
- __timeout__ The timeout for the request. Defaults to OTGW_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT (3 seconds).

Returns the ID that was removed from the list, or None on failure.

This method is a coroutine.

---
##### OpenThermGateway.del_unknown_id(_self_, unknown_id, timeout=OTGW_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)
Start forwarding the specified Data-ID to the boiler again.
This command resets the counter used to determine if the specified data-ID is supported by the boiler.
This method supports the following arguments:
- __unknown_id__ The data-ID to mark as supported. Values from 1 to 255 are allowed.
- __timeout__ The timeout for the request. Defaults to OTGW_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT (3 seconds).

Return the ID that was marked as supported, or None on failure.

This method is a coroutine.

---
##### OpenThermGateway.get_reports(_self_)
Update the OpenThermGateway object with the information from all of the `PR` commands.
This method is also called from `OpenThermGateway.connect()` to populate the status dict with initial values.

### Usage Example
```python
import asyncio
from pyotgw import OpenThermGateway

PORT = '/dev/ttyUSB0'


async def print_status(status):
  """Receive and print status."""
  print("Received a status update:\n{}".format(status))


async def connect_and_subscribe():
  """Connect to the OpenTherm Gateway and subscribe to status updates."""

  # Create the object
  gw = OpenThermGateway()

  # Connect to OpenTherm Gateway on PORT
  status = await gw.connect(asyncio.get_event_loop(), PORT)
  print("Initial status after connecting:\n{}".format(status))

  # Subscribe to updates from the gateway
  if not gw.subscribe(print_status):
    print("Could not subscribe to status updates.")

  # Keep the event loop alive...
  while True:
    await asyncio.sleep(1)


# Set up the event loop and run the connect_and_subscribe coroutine.
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
try:
  loop.run_until_complete(connect_and_subscribe())
except KeyboardInterrupt:
  print("Exiting")

```

### Development
We use pre-commit to ensure a consistent code style, so `pip install pre_commit` and run
```
pre-commit install
```
in the repository.

### Status Dict Structure
The full possible status dict with some example values looks like below. Note that not all keys will always be present and that the presence of a key does not guarantee that it contains useful information.
